My favorite color is red!
My favorite class is japanese, CSP and English
I came from other country name Bangladesh.
I had eight kittens and 3 cats which was really fun and little bit of troublesome
If i talk about my country and USA then I will say USA is better than Bangladesh.
My country is still growing, we had a big fight on july and augest 5th was the independece for the students and the citizen
I am mostly like a cat person.
Last year was my first time watching snow and it was really fun
I didn't catch cold, fever or anything so thats record for me.
I love coding and wants to be a pogrammer or a developer.
